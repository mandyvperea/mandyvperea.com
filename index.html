  <p> My name is Mandy Perea and I love to make art about bugs!</p>
  <p> I will be graduating from CalArts with a Bachelors degree in Fine Arts with a minor in Digital Arts this May. I am a multi-media artist, currently interested in making work about both international and local environments within the context of natural history museums. I am also interested in overarching concepts of identity including but not limited to gender, sexuality, race, and ability. My interests that currently reside outside of my art practice are video games, true crime, & reality TV.</p>
